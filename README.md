# UFOs

In this project, I built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Including filters to make the table fully dynamic, reacting to user input, and then placed the table into an HTML file. I then customized the webpage using Bootstrap, and equipped the table with several fully functional filters that allow users to interact with the visualizations.

## Summary

A drawback that the webpage has is that the data is limited, it only gives you information about UFO sightings throughout January 2010 in the US. In order to make the data more inclusive and revealing, we could add more countires, all months, and more years. I would recommend Dana to look for more information online, that includes different countries and a variety of dates. We could add that information to our data.apps file in the same format. Another recommendation would be to make the website more user-friendly and aesthetically appealing.
